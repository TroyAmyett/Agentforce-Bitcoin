## Video 1: Welcome Overview
**4 scenes | ~1:30 estimated**

### Scene 1 — Head (avatar only)
> Hey there. Welcome to the Funnelists Support Portal... a modern, self-service support experience built right on top of Salesforce. I'm going to give you a quick tour so you can see everything it offers.

### Scene 2 — PIP (avatar over screen recording)
*Screen: After login, dashboard visible*
> After logging in, you land on your personalized dashboard. At the top, you see your case stats at a glance... open cases, closed cases, and total cases. There's a search bar that lets you find help articles instantly. Below that are quick-action cards to get to any section in one click.

### Scene 3 — PIP
*Screen: Scrolling dashboard, product articles*
> Scroll down and you'll see Popular Articles organized by product. You can filter by product to find exactly what you need. And at the bottom, your most recent cases so you can pick up right where you left off.

### Scene 4 — Head
> The portal is fully branded with your company's logo, colors, and domain. Your customers see your brand... not ours. When they register, the portal automatically matches their email domain to the right account in your Salesforce org. No manual setup. No orphan records. Let's dive deeper into the features. I'll show you how cases work next.

## Video 2: Managing Cases
**4 scenes | ~1:45 estimated**

### Scene 1 — PIP
*Screen: Case list loaded*
> Let's look at cases. This is where your customers interact with your support team. The case list shows all their cases with status badges, priorities, and timestamps. You can filter by status... open, closed, or all.

### Scene 2 — PIP
*Screen: Inside a case detail*
> Click into any case to see the full conversation. Comments appear in a threaded timeline with timestamps. Your team's replies are clearly distinguished from customer messages. You can add comments, and they flow right into Salesforce.

### Scene 3 — PIP
*Screen: Showing attachments / new case*
> Attachments are fully supported... images, videos, PDFs, documents. Customers can paste screenshots directly from their clipboard, drag and drop files, or use the upload button. Video attachments even play inline. Creating a new case is simple... pick a subject, set the priority, describe the issue, and submit. It routes into Salesforce instantly.

### Scene 4 — Head
> Every case, comment, and attachment syncs natively with Salesforce Service Cloud. Your agents work in the tools they already know, while your customers get a modern self-service experience. And every case update, comment, and closure triggers a branded email notification... all customizable from Salesforce Email Templates.

## Video 3: Help & Ideas
**3 scenes | ~1:15 estimated**

### Scene 1 — PIP
*Screen: Help page loaded*
> The Help section gives your customers a searchable library of FAQs organized by category. They can expand any section to find answers, or use the search bar to find exactly what they're looking for. These FAQs can be hand-written by your team... or generated by AI. I'll show you how that works in the admin tools video.

### Scene 2 — PIP
*Screen: Ideas page*
> The Ideas page turns your portal into a feedback loop. Customers submit feature requests and product ideas. Other users can vote on the ideas they care about... giving your team clear signal on what matters most. It's a simple, powerful way to prioritize your roadmap based on real customer input.

### Scene 3 — Head
> Help and Ideas work together to reduce support volume. When customers can find their own answers and feel heard through the ideas process, fewer tickets come in... and the ones that do are higher quality.

## Video 4: Knowledge Base
**4 scenes | ~1:30 estimated**

### Scene 1 — Head
> Let's talk about the Knowledge Base. A great support portal doesn't just let customers file tickets... it helps them find answers on their own. The Support Portal ships with a full knowledge system powered by Salesforce.

### Scene 2 — PIP
*Screen: Knowledge base browsing, categories visible*
> Articles are organized by product and category... Getting Started, Troubleshooting, Features, Integrations, and more. Customers can browse by topic or search across the entire library. Each article is structured with clear headings, step-by-step instructions, and relevant details.

### Scene 3 — PIP
*Screen: Searching, article detail view*
> The search is fast and filters results in real time. Click into any article to see the full content. Articles are stored in Salesforce Knowledge... so your team manages them with the tools they already know. Publish, update, or archive articles from Salesforce Setup, and the portal reflects changes immediately.

### Scene 4 — Head
> Knowledge articles also power the AI. When customers ask the AI Assistant a question, it pulls from your published articles and FAQs for grounding... so answers are accurate, contextual, and specific to your products. The more you invest in your knowledge base, the smarter your entire support experience becomes.

## Video 5: AI Assistant
**3 scenes | ~1:15 estimated**

### Scene 1 — Head
> Now let's talk about the AI Assistant. This is a bring-your-own-key LLM chat... powered by Claude or OpenAI, whichever your team prefers. It's not a generic chatbot. It knows your products, your FAQs, and your support patterns.

### Scene 2 — PIP
*Screen: Chat widget open*
> Click the chat button in the bottom corner to open the assistant. Ask a question in natural language... and the AI responds using your help content and case history as grounding context. It pulls from your published FAQs and recent cases to give accurate, relevant answers. If it can't answer, it guides customers to create a support case.

### Scene 3 — Head
> The AI Assistant is configured by admins in Portal Settings. Choose your provider... Claude or OpenAI. Enter your API key. Select your model. It's fully bring-your-own-key, so you control the costs and the provider relationship. Available to admin users, and can be toggled on or off anytime.

## Video 6: Admin Tools
**5 scenes | ~2:00 estimated**

### Scene 1 — Head
> Let's look at the admin side. Portal Admins and Super Admins get a full management suite with five powerful tools. Let me walk you through each one.

### Scene 2 — PIP
*Screen: Admin dashboard*
> The Admin Dashboard gives you a bird's eye view... total users, active users, pending registrations, and case stats. User Management lets you search users by name or email, activate or deactivate accounts, and assign roles. Two roles are available... User and Portal Admin.

### Scene 3 — PIP
*Screen: FAQ Generator*
> The FAQ Manager is where AI meets content. Paste any document... a product guide, a troubleshooting doc, release notes... and the AI generates FAQ question-and-answer pairs automatically. Review each one, edit if needed, and publish with a single click. Published FAQs go live on the Help page instantly.

### Scene 4 — PIP
*Screen: Portal Settings*
> Portal Settings is your command center. Configure the AI provider and model, set the chat mode, manage branding, and control which features are visible in the portal. Branding even lets you extract your website's look and feel with a single URL. Everything saves to Salesforce, so your settings persist. There's also a full set of branded email templates for welcome emails, password resets, and case notifications... all editable by your team right in Salesforce Setup.

### Scene 5 — Head
> All of these admin tools are available right in the portal... no switching to Salesforce Setup. But if you prefer, there's also a dedicated Lightning App in Salesforce for managing portal data directly.

---

## Video 7: Agentforce Integration
**4 scenes | ~1:45 estimated**

### Scene 1 — Head
> Let's talk about something that makes this portal unique... deep Agentforce integration. The Support Portal supports three distinct chat modes, all configurable from Portal Settings... no code changes required.

### Scene 2 — PIP
*Screen: Portal Settings showing mode selector*
> Mode one is the Built-in Assistant... a lightweight keyword-based helper that runs entirely in the browser. Mode two is Salesforce Messaging for Web... which connects to a real Agentforce Service Agent. Customers chat with an AI agent that can look up cases, search your knowledge base, and escalate to a live agent when needed. Mode three is the AI Assistant with your own LLM key... Claude or OpenAI.

### Scene 3 — PIP
*Screen: Salesforce side — Lightning App, cases*
> On the Salesforce side, everything is native. Cases, contacts, comments, attachments... all standard Salesforce objects. There's a dedicated Lightning App with custom tabs for managing FAQs, Ideas, Themes, and Sessions. Your Agentforce agent can be grounded with a Data Library of product documentation for accurate, contextual responses.

### Scene 4 — Head
> The Funnelists Support Portal. Branded, intelligent, and built on Salesforce with native Agentforce integration. Onboarding is automatic... customers self-register and the portal matches their email domain to the right account in your org. No manual provisioning. Whether your team uses Claude, OpenAI, or Salesforce Agentforce... the portal adapts to your stack. Visit funnelists.com or reach out to schedule a demo. Thanks for watching.

## Video 8: Theme & Style Importer
**3 scenes | ~0:45 estimated**

### Scene 1 — Head
> Want to see something cool? The Support Portal can import your brand identity from any website... automatically. Just paste a URL and watch.

### Scene 2 — PIP
*Screen: Admin entering URL, extraction happening, live preview*
> In Portal Settings, paste your website URL and hit Extract. The portal scans your site and pulls your logo, primary colors, background colors, and font choices. You see a live preview instantly... your portal, your brand, in seconds. Adjust anything you want, then save. The theme applies across every page of the portal. Your customers never see a generic interface... they see you.

### Scene 3 — Head
> No design tools. No CSS. No tickets to your dev team. Just paste a URL and your support portal looks like it was built in-house. That's the Theme and Style Importer.

---

## Video 9: Doc-to-FAQ Import
**3 scenes | ~0:50 estimated**

### Scene 1 — Head
> Building out a help center usually takes weeks. Writing FAQ articles, organizing categories, reviewing content... it's a grind. What if you could skip all of that? The Support Portal lets you turn any document into a published FAQ library in under a minute.

### Scene 2 — PIP
*Screen: FAQ Manager, pasting a document, AI generating pairs*
> Open the FAQ Manager, paste your document... a product guide, release notes, a troubleshooting doc, anything. Hit Generate, and the AI reads the entire document and produces structured question-and-answer pairs. Each one is categorized automatically. Review the results, edit any you want to fine-tune, then publish with a single click. Flip over to the Help page... and they're live. Your customers can search and browse them immediately.

### Scene 3 — Head
> Here's the best part. Those published FAQs don't just sit on a page. They become grounding context for your AI... whether you're using Agentforce, Claude, OpenAI, or your own trained model. Upload your docs, and every AI touchpoint in the portal gets smarter. One import powers your entire self-service experience.

---

## Video 10: Screen Recording
**3 scenes | ~0:45 estimated**

### Scene 1 — Head
> Every support team knows the pain. A customer says something is broken, but the description doesn't capture it. Three emails later, you're still guessing. The Support Portal eliminates that entirely with a built-in screen recorder.

### Scene 2 — PIP
*Screen: Case form with Record button, recording flow, auto-attach*
> When submitting a case, click the Record Screen button. The browser asks which screen or tab to share... select it, and you're recording. Reproduce the issue while the portal captures everything. Click Stop, and the recording is automatically attached to the case. No separate tools. No file exports. No uploading. Your support agent opens the case and sees the exact issue, in motion, in context. They can play the video right inside the case detail view.

### Scene 3 — Head
> One click to record. One click to stop. The video is on the case. It saves time for the customer, saves time for the agent, and gets issues resolved faster. No more back and forth trying to describe what went wrong... just show it.
