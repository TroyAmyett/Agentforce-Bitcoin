# Support Portal — HeyGen Product Walkthrough Script

**Video Type:** HeyGen AI Avatar Presenter + Screen Recording
**Target Length:** 3–4 minutes
**Audience:** Prospective customers, decision makers
**Tone:** Professional, confident, conversational

---

## SCENE 1 — INTRO (Avatar, no screen)
**Duration:** ~15 seconds

> Every support team wants the same thing — faster resolutions, happier customers, and less overhead. That's exactly what the Funnelists Support Portal delivers. It's a fully branded, self-service portal that sits right on top of Salesforce — giving your customers a modern support experience while your team stays in the tools they already know.
>
> Let me show you how it works.

---

## SCENE 2 — LOGIN & BRANDING (Screen: Login page)
**Duration:** ~15 seconds

> The portal is fully white-labeled. Your logo, your colors, your domain. When customers visit, they see your brand — not ours. Registration is simple: name, email, company, and they're in. Returning users log in with email and password, and there's a full forgot-password flow built in.

**[Screen action: Show login page with branded theme, then log in]**

---

## SCENE 3 — DASHBOARD (Screen: Dashboard)
**Duration:** ~30 seconds

> After logging in, customers land on a personalized dashboard. At the top, they see their case stats at a glance — open cases, closed cases, and total cases. There's a universal search bar that searches across help articles instantly.
>
> Below that are quick-action cards: Help articles, AI Assistant, Create a Case, and Ideas. And at the bottom, we surface Popular Articles filtered by product — so customers find answers before they even open a ticket.

**[Screen action: Show dashboard, hover over stats, click search, scroll to product articles with filter pills]**

---

## SCENE 4 — CASES (Screen: Case List → Case Detail → New Case)
**Duration:** ~40 seconds

> The Cases section is where the real work happens. Customers see all their cases with status filters and pagination. They can click into any case to see the full conversation thread — comments from both sides, timestamps, and attachments.
>
> Attachments support images, videos, PDFs, and documents. Customers can paste screenshots directly from their clipboard, drag and drop files, or use the upload button. Video attachments play inline — no downloads needed.
>
> Creating a new case is straightforward: pick a subject, choose a priority, describe the issue, and submit. The case routes into Salesforce instantly.

**[Screen action: Show case list → click into a case → scroll through comments and attachments → show New Case form]**

---

## SCENE 5 — HELP (Screen: Help / KB page)
**Duration:** ~20 seconds

> The Help section gives customers a searchable library of FAQs organized by category. These can be hand-written by your team, or — and this is the exciting part — generated by AI. Admins upload documentation, and our AI engine creates structured Q-and-A pairs automatically. More on that in a moment.

**[Screen action: Show Help page, expand a few accordion items, use the search bar]**

---

## SCENE 6 — IDEAS & VOTING (Screen: Ideas page)
**Duration:** ~20 seconds

> The Ideas page turns your portal into a feedback loop. Customers submit feature requests and product ideas. Other users can vote on ideas they care about — so your team sees exactly what matters most. It's a simple, powerful way to prioritize your roadmap based on real customer input.

**[Screen action: Show Ideas list, click vote button on an idea, show the count increment]**

---

## SCENE 7 — AI ASSISTANT (Screen: Chat widget)
**Duration:** ~30 seconds

> Now let's talk about the AI Assistant. This is a bring-your-own-key LLM chat — powered by Claude or OpenAI, whichever your team prefers. Customers ask questions in natural language, and the AI responds using your help content and case history as grounding context.
>
> It's not a generic chatbot. It knows your products, your FAQs, and your support patterns. And if it can't answer, it guides customers to create a case. The chat is available to admin users and can be toggled on or off from Portal Settings.

**[Screen action: Open chat FAB → send a question → show AI response → show quick action buttons]**

---

## SCENE 8 — ADMIN FEATURES (Screen: Admin pages)
**Duration:** ~40 seconds

> On the admin side, Portal Admins and Super Admins get a full management suite. The Admin Dashboard shows user and case statistics. User Management lets you search users, activate or deactivate accounts, and assign roles.
>
> The FAQ Manager is where AI meets content. Paste a document — a product guide, a troubleshooting doc, anything — and the AI generates FAQ pairs that you can review, edit, and publish with one click. Published FAQs go live on the Help page automatically.
>
> Branding lets you extract your website's look and feel with one URL. And Portal Settings is your command center — configure the AI provider, choose your model, set the chat mode, and control what features are visible in the portal.

**[Screen action: Quick montage — Admin Dashboard → User Management → FAQ Manager (paste doc, generate) → Branding → Portal Settings]**

---

## SCENE 9 — SALESFORCE INTEGRATION (Avatar, with Salesforce logo/screenshot)
**Duration:** ~20 seconds

> Everything flows back to Salesforce. Cases, contacts, comments, attachments — it's all native Salesforce data. Your agents work in Service Cloud like they always have. There's even a dedicated Lightning app for managing portal objects — FAQs, Ideas, Themes, and Sessions — all from within Salesforce Setup.

**[Screen action: Brief shot of Salesforce Lightning App with custom tabs]**

---

## SCENE 10 — AGENTFORCE MODES (Avatar or screen)
**Duration:** ~15 seconds

> And for teams using Salesforce Agentforce, we support three chat modes: a built-in keyword assistant, Salesforce Messaging for Web with a real Agentforce service agent, or the AI Assistant with your own LLM key. Switch between them anytime from Portal Settings — no code changes required.

---

## SCENE 11 — OUTRO (Avatar, no screen)
**Duration:** ~15 seconds

> The Funnelists Support Portal — branded, intelligent, and built on Salesforce. If you're ready to give your customers a better support experience, let's talk.
